# Development Story 101

## 1. Story Overview  
**What are you working on?**  
- Provide a concise description of the task (e.g., feature development, setup, testing, research, proof of concept).  

**Why does this matter?**  
- Explain the problem this task solves or the value it brings to users or the business.  

**What defines success?**  
- Clearly define what "done" means for this task. What are the key outcomes or goals for this phase (e.g., working feature, test passed, proof of concept validated)?  

**Technology Stack**  
- List all technologies, frameworks, tools, or APIs you will be working with (e.g., GCP, Python, Docker, Terraform, Postman).

## 2. Problem Breakdown & Goals  
**What problem are you solving?**  
- Identify the specific issue, challenge, or goal for this task. This could be a bug fix, feature requirement, research exploration, or environment setup.  

**Who is impacted?**  
- Describe who benefits from this (e.g., end users, other teams, business stakeholders).  

**What are the expected outcomes in the next 3-4 days?**  
- Break down the task into clear deliverables or goals (e.g., successful setup, working prototype, test results, defined scope for next phase).  

**Risks & Dependencies**  
- Identify potential blockers or external dependencies that could affect progress (e.g., awaiting approvals, dependencies on other teams, missing documentation).

## 3. Research & Approach  
**What’s your plan of action?**  
- Provide a detailed plan for how you intend to tackle this task (e.g., research required, tools to use, testing approach).  

**What’s the approach to achieve this?**  
- For development: how will you implement this? What steps will you take?  
- For research: what will you investigate? How will you test your findings?  
- For testing: what features, scenarios, or edge cases will you cover?  
- For proof of concept (PoC): what experiments will you run, and how will you validate results?  

**What documentation or resources do you need?**  
- Identify internal or external resources (documentation, code repositories, APIs) you need to review or consult.  

**Who needs to be consulted?**  
- List people (e.g., tech leads, subject matter experts) you need to collaborate with or get approvals from.

## 4. Execution Plan  
**How will you break down the work?**  
- Break the task into manageable steps. This could include phases for setup, coding, testing, research, or exploration.  

**Key Milestones (for the first 3-4 days):**  
- **Day 1-2:** Research, planning, or setup (e.g., access provisioning, environment setup, initial exploration).  
- **Day 3-4:** Development or testing work, experimentation, or PoC validation.  

**What are the expected deliverables?**  
- List what you will deliver by the end of these 3-4 days (e.g., working local setup, prototype, test results, PoC demo).  

**Testing Plan (if applicable):**  
- Identify which tests are needed (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, system tests).  
- What edge cases or scenarios will be tested?

## 5. Blockers, Risks & Dependencies  
**What could prevent progress?**  
- Identify any blockers you foresee in this task (e.g., lack of access, missing information, toolchain issues).  

**What dependencies need to be resolved?**  
- Are there dependencies on other team members, teams, or external services that need to be addressed?  

**How will you mitigate these risks?**  
- Outline any steps you will take to prevent or resolve the identified blockers or risks.
